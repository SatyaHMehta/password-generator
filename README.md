For the most part, I was ok with the project. I kenw how I had to approach it, hoever, I am somewhat behind on my studies, so I had to do alot of googling. I still can not get the code to work as I want because I wanted to add some addditional features, but I got it to work 90-95% of how I intended. I will for sure catchup up during this holiday break. 

Overall the difficulty of the project was meidum-hard at best. Had I been completely on point with my studies, I believe I would have not had as much of a hard time.
